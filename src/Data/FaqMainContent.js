                You are entering a church wedding, and basic courtesy tells us to respect proper decorum in church.
                The Manila Cathedral, as a Catholic church, 
                adheres to the teachings of the Catholic faith regarding the difference and complementarity of man and woman,
                and the proper attire for a man and a woman reflects this. Therefore, the members of the wedding entourage are to be dressed appropriately.
                Guests not included in the entourage are welcome to join the ceremony as long as they will obey all rules placed by Manila Cathedral`
